Name: Get Feed

METHOD: GET

URL: /feed/:username?lastpost=aabbcc&pagesize=20

Description: Returns a page of posts for a user

The :username parameter specifies the alias of the user we want followers for.

The lastpost parameter ensures that only results that are after the cursor (lastpost) will be returned.  This is typically the key of the last item returned in the previous page.  If lastpost is not specified, the first page of posts is returned.

The pagesize parameter specifies the maximum number of posts to return (but it might return less).  If pagesize is not specified, it defaults to 15.
